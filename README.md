## Build a Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a simple neural network from scratch using Python, NumPy, and fundamental mathematical principles. It provides a hands-on understanding of how neural networks function and the underlying mathematical concepts involved in training them.

### Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a basic neural network capable of performing simple classification tasks. We'll achieve this by:

- **Implementing the core neural network components**: 
    - **Neuron:**  Representing individual computational units with activation functions.
    - **Layer:**  Organizing multiple neurons into layers for complex calculations.
    - **Network Architecture:** Defining the structure of the network with multiple layers.
- **Developing the training process**:
    - **Forward Propagation:** Calculating the output of the network based on input data and weights.
    - **Backpropagation Algorithm:**  Calculating the gradient of the error function with respect to weights and using it to update weights for improved accuracy.
- **Evaluating the performance**:
    - **Loss function:** Measuring the difference between predicted and actual outputs.
    - **Accuracy metrics:** Quantifying the network's ability to make correct predictions.

**Key Features:**

- **Code written entirely in Python using NumPy:**  Demonstrates the core concepts without external libraries.
- **Emphasis on mathematical understanding:**  Provides clear explanations of the underlying principles and algorithms.
- **Simple, modular code structure:**  Easy to understand and modify for different network configurations.
- **Thorough documentation and comments:**  Facilitates learning and exploration of the code.
